<h1> CODING</h1>
<p> Coding creates a set of instructions for computers to follow.
     These instructions determine what actions a computer can
     and cannot take. Coding allows programmers to build 
     programs, such as websites and apps. Computer programmers 
     can also tell computers how to process data in better,
      faster ways. </p>
